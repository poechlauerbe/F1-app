        The idea of this project is to create an application where you can find live data during a race-weekend.The data is fetched from the openF1 API and displayed in a user-friendly way. The application is built with Node.js, Express, and EJS. The app is still in progress. If you have any suggestions or feedback, feel free to contact me.
